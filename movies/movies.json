Another RomCom Feel-Good genre. Not much to look on the comedy side. One of the movies, where teenagers are really hot, mature, good looking and far beyond their age, which makes you wonder how did it go wrong for you? The movie has nothing spectatcular to offer but if you like Hailee Steinfeld, then it's a treat.",

      "description": "Interesting. Some episodes were really slow and can't wait to finish them. Lots of good plot twist. Didn't watch the last season tho. I think it's getting a little stretched now. First couple of season were good. I still have to watch the last season, but have no such plans at the moment. It surely has it's moment, biggest strengths being it's unpredicatable nature, lots of twists (really lot) and creative writing. Overall, I'll recommend you to watch it but not force you.",

      "description": "First couple of seasons were brilliant, all uphill from there. The seasons got worse and worse as they progressed. Thankfully, they creators announced season4 to be the last season. It is supposed to be a Drama, but the creators tried to raise too many issues like Sexual Assault, Bully, School Shotting, Depression, Anxiety, and everything they can find online (not relevant). Failed Miserably. At the end it makes you wonder what message are the creators exactly trying to raise??. A stretched, mostly forgettable season",

      "description": "Time watse. Time waste. Time waste. The story is basically nothing, some random rich people's problem. The two co-stars are horny as fuck. Makeout and sex scenes every 10-15 min. They talk some random shit and then start making out. Even when they are fighting, angry or in general, they somehow always end up makeing out. The actress is hot, the actor is irritating. The movie does nothing but make you feel jealous, why an average, annoying, dumb guy and a terrible actor is making out with a hot and sexy actress. I literally just watched the entire movie, looking at Josephine Langford and cursing myself.",
