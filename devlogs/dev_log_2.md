Hey,

Today I completely changed my [portfolio website](https://harshitsinghai77.github.io/). Yeah. I completely dropped the initial site and rewrote the entire thing using vanilla Javascript and css.

Here: [https://harshitsinghai77.github.io/](https://harshitsinghai77.github.io/)

Using React to power a simple static website was a overkill from the very beginning. I completely scractched it off and went back to simple HTML+JS+CSS world.

The new site is much faster (obviously) and better and loads quickly.

Apart from it, I spent a lot of time working on my blog/devlogs static site (The same thing you are currently reading this). Was it worth putting this time and effort? Only time will tell. Will see if the effort was worth the energy and time. Hopefully, I write daily, atleast the dev logs.

So basically, I worked on my blog and my static site portfolio.

Learnings: NextJS, When to use NextJS, Vercel and copy-paste html css.

Outcomes: My own dev logs to better assess my productivity and to keep track of my software journey. Better portfolio static website.
