Hey, Welcome to my first dev log. I'll be keeping things simple here. No technical stuff, but more like "how's it going" and "what are you working on" space....

Today, I worked on my own blog. I like the idea to maintain my own developer log. The point is to keep track of my day-to-day work, log my progress, make them public and to create better habbits. Setting up my own blog/devlogs will allow me to get better insights of my daily routine and how much productive I was throughout the day. I will also help me keep track of what I learned during the day.

Initially, I was going with simple react but I wanted something with Server side rendering goodness, and also something which is not alien to SEO and which is respected by google bots.

I was also a little inclined to learn something or pick up a new skill on my way to setup my own blog. So, I somehow stumbled upon Nextjs.

The tutorial guide in the offical website is really great. I looked it up, followed every step and everything fell in space and here I have it, my blog/develop logs static site generator.

I fickled along the docs, read the tutorial, checked few repos, read few articles to check how they have done. Had trouble setting up the code snippet support in the readme.md file and automatically adding styles to code highlighter. This took me a while to figure it out and I ended up wating some time.

Long story short, at the end I figured out a way to setup my own blog/developer logs. Also, I got the chance to learn Vercel. Vercel is doing some amazing job out there. I higly recommend checking it. It's mainly used to deploy Nextjs or React app and lot more.

Learning: NextJS, Server Side Rendering, SEO with React, Vercel.

Outcome: Documenting my software engineer journey. Better way to keep track of my day.
