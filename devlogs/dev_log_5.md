Hey,

Woke up early, so that's a positive. Woke up around 8 am, did some meditation (reciepe for a perfect day), but unfortunately it wasn't a perfect day. I eagerly waited for the introductory interview at 10am (lots of anxiety) for Deepsource. Fortunately it went well, got the second call for tomorrow, hope it goes well too. If tomorrow's interview goes well then maybe I have a chance.

Disapointed for tomorrow's standup pod meeting. I haven't contributed to BentoML. Not even a bit. I hope I can turn the tides around before it's too late. I've to start working on Bentoml at any cost. It's been a lot of procastination and it's time to contribute to Bentoml (for real).

In terms of my development, I started the day with my Go book. I learned how to develop microservices using go-kit. Then something happened and I decided to add a new feature to my gogist command line utility tool. Now you can create your own github timelime using the command line tool and it will render a html file based on the data you get via the github request. The utility doesn't add anything but I wanted to create a static HTML generator using Go and I learned something (hope so. I also added content to my Go - Introduction blog post.

Other than adding the github timeline feature in gogist, I didn't do much.

Also, I formed a team for the MLH Midweek Hackathon. The guy is from Bulgaria, I don't know how it will pan out but I hope we can build something cool for the hackathon. I have really high hopes from the hackathon so let's see how it goes. Excited for it.

So basically my day was Interview -> Go microservices -> feature to gogist -> write go blog post -> form MLH team (gitner)

Improvements: Contribute to BentoML and start taking it seriously.

Learnings: Go

Outcomes: new feature to gogist
