Last day of 2019,

Spent the whole day working on my [blog](https://fictionally-irrelevant.vercel.app/). Made it more responsive, introduced [Movie Logs](https://fictionally-irrelevant.vercel.app/movies), something that will keep me accountable to the number and quality of movies I watch throughout the year. I think it's a good addition, but it took more time than I anticipated. I also spend sometime working on the landing page for my new unnamed product.

I plan to complete my new product soon. Probably a beta version around June-July.

Tomorrow, I will be working on Anton, write DEPS, ML Infrastructure Spec and learn more about MLOps. Read the pending books I've been trying to read but couldn't because something comes up everytime I try to read.

**Improvements**: Read books.

**Learnings**: Tailwindcss, Preact (not worth time, useless)

**Outcomes**: Introduced MovieLogs in my personal blog.
