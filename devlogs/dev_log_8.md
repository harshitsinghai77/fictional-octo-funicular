Hey,

I've been slacking off, again. Worked in Anton for the last few weeks. Nothing good came out of it yet. Haven't been giving my 100% to be honest. But now I have no choice but to complete it.

I've enrolled myself for MLH again. My pod mentor Kunal took my interview for the MLH Spring 2021 batch. I've yet to hear back from MLH. Lets see how it goes. I might get selected again, maybe not. I donno.

I worked on [Noisly Clone](https://noisli.netlify.app/). It's a good project, hopefully I will be able to turn it into something good.

I've also formed a team for Honda Hackathon and submitted the proposal. Still awaiting for the idea submission results.

Got the results for the Pychamp Hackathon, I didn't won any price but I'm happy with [Pluto](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/pluto).

**Improvements**: Work on Anton, learn Kubeflow.

**Learnings**: Nothing.

**Outcomes**: Honda Hackathon, MLH Fellowship Interview, Released Nosli
