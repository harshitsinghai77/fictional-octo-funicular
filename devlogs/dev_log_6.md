Hey,

Yesterday I took a full-day break. Watched "Ludo" in netflix. It was okish. Today I heard backed from the company I interviewed with. Tomorrow's my 3rd round (probably last round). I hope everything works out well and I can get an internship. The company looks good, they might give me some machine learning projects, or prabably I'll write some Go too, who knows. I'm looking to do some good work and I do think working there will be great for my career. I hope I get in.

On the development front, I started the day with Generative Modelling book. I finished the first 2 chapters. Will read some more tomorrow. Also, I tried reading the Go book, but did't make much progress.

I've to start working on the mid-week MLH hackathon. That will be the first thing on my list.

So apart from reading the generative modeling book, no progress as such. Today was not a very productive day. I went to play football tho, so that's a positive as far as my physical activities are concerned.

Improvements: Be more productive.

Learnings: Machine learning basics.

Outcomes: Nothing.
