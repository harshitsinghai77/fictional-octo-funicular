Hey, Happy Diwali,

Learned some more Go. Getting pretty comfortable with the docs and with go in general, it all has started to make sense. Still reading the book,

> Building RESTful Web services with Go: Learn how to build powerful RESTful APIs with Golang that scale gracefully.

It's pretty awesome.

I learned a lot about go with this book most prominantly protobuff and gRPC. The book has some really great hands on example. Learned how to connect MongoDB, Postgres with Go, created a bid-directional streaming API using gRPC and protobuff.

Also, I deployed my Postgres instance using Heroku add-ons and connected it with Go for the Felix. Yeah, Felix - my own URL shortening service. More about that on a seperate blog post.

Go docs has started to make more sense lately. I have began to understand the whole interface{} return type and go polymorphism. Now, I'll probably catch up on BentoML, get started with the midweek hackathon and then the interview on Monday morning (fingers crossed).

Also I celebrated Diwali, ofcourse.

Learnings: Go, Deployed felix (still adding more features).

Outcomes: Enjoyed Diwali, deployed felix in production.
