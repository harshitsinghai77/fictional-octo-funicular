The final submission for our hackathon project was today! I was excited to demo our project CovidAid and take a look at what the other teams had come up with. This is the first time I participated in a hackathon and I had a great time collaborating with my teammates over the past week. We did not end up getting selected for the Global Finals, but that is completely irrelevant personally, I am extremely happy to have a fully functioning prototype application that we developed!
