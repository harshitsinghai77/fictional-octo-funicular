Hey,

I woke up around 11am, probably... I immediately started working on Felix to add the link expiry feature. I didn't complete it but it's almost done. Probably needs less than an hour more. I worked on it till 4pm, (yeah I know... how could a simple feature take so looong??).

I need to find a better way to work on features more effeciently. I should probably take more breaks. Break are really essential. Usually I'm way too focus working that I often forget taking frequent breaks, resulting in loss of efficiency, productivity, and time. I keep on fixiting on the same bug again and again and again without thinking it through, this could be due to lack of breaks. I need to improve on that front else I'll end up wasting a lot of time.

After working on the felix feature (which should've been much easier) I took a little break before started working on gogist.

Gogist is a command line utility tool to create gist from the given file or from the given directly. Obviosly I used go (if you can't tell it from the programme name already). Using go for command line utility tool further strengthen my go fundamentals.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. Just [Felix](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/go-felix) and [gogist](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/gogist) for today. Still need to focus more on the MLH midweek hackathon, and BentoML from tomorrow onwards. Also, I've an interview tomorrow early morning. Let's see how it goes. Probably I'll have a better news for tomorrow's dev logs. See ya.

Improvements: Take frequent breaks, write roadmap for the feature before starting the development, finish features quickly, be more efficient.

Learnings: Go, command line with go, go time library and how postgres timestamp type work.

Outcomes: gogist, felix expire link feature.
