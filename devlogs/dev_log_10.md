Merry Christmas,

Recieved a courier present from DeepSource (how thoughtful) for christmas. It includes bakery products like organic cake, rumcake, cupcake, wine and a couple of more things. This company really do care about its employees. Linkedin post to be followed soon.

Started the day strongly, slacked off a little during the afternoon. Read some book, read about Kubeflow, tried installing Kubeflow for dev (failed miserably). Had a call to brainstorm ideas for the new product. Brainstormed few ideas have to start working on the product soon.

Overall it wasn't the greatest day but not a bad day either.

**Improvements**: Do more things, make better use of the day.

**Learnings**: Marketing, Kubeflow.

**Outcomes**: None.
