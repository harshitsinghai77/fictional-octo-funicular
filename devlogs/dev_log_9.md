Hey,

Worked on Noisly Clone, added some features, timer, context API etc. Releasing it soon. I'll start working on the backend later. Noisli is more like a dry run when it comes to starting out my own company. With Noisli, my aim is to get my foot wet, get exposure and see if I can really manage to work on a real project with dedication and focus.

Spent too much time on Noisli. I've to dedicate more time in Anton. I've been slacking off a lot when it comes to working. There's no pressure at the moment, but I want to build my reputation as someone who gets the job done. So no Noisli before 11pm.

**Improvements**: Plan your time better.

**Learnings**: React Context API and few other minor things.

**Outcomes**: Noisli Release.
