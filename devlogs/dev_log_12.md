First day of 2021,

Started the day a little bit too late, it wasn't a much productive day, didn't do anything in particular but I decided on the roadmap for 2021. Created my roadmap and my goals of what I want a successfuly year to look like.

Read a bit about MLOps. Read some more study material and articles. Talked to a couple of friends and tried reading

Tomorrow, I will be working on Anton, DEPS, ML Infrastructure Spec and learn more about MLOps.

**Improvements**: Plan your day ahead.

**Learnings**: Read book.

**Outcomes**: Nothing in particular.
