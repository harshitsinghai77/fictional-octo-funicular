First day of 2021,

Started the day a little bit late, wasn't a productive day overall, didn't do anything in particular but finalized the roadmap for 2021. Created my roadmap and my goals of what I want a successfuly year to look like.

Read about MLOps. Went through the study material and read few articles. Talked to friends.

Tomorrow, I will be working on Anton, DEPS, ML Infrastructure Spec and learn more about MLOps.

**Improvements**: Plan your day ahead.

**Learnings**: Read book.

**Outcomes**: Nothing in particular.
