Hey,

It's been a while since I wrote my last dev log. I hope to get back into this habbit of writing dev logs daily. Spent last few weeks working on few side projects. Most prominantly Pluto (No sleep for 24 days mode) and also Gitner (MLH Midweek hackathon Project). Besides that I took few days off from coding and learning to relax a bit, watched a couple of movies and relaxed a bit. The plan was to take a day off but somehow I ended up taking 4-5 days off.

It's really hard to get back in once the habit breaks. I'm trying to get back into my productive hours again.

So let's start with a good news. I got a 6 months Software Engineer Internship at deepsource. The company looks good and I think this will be a good fit for me. After 4 rounds of interview, I finally got the offer. Plus, I'll be working on a machine learning project. So that's great. Working on a good project in a developer centric product. This is what I was looking for. I'll be working on Anton and I'm soley responsible for it. So that's interesting.

Some bad news, I dropped off from MLH Fellowship. I will no longer be contributing to MLH or bentoml. This is to focus soley on deepsource and try to minimize other work or distractions. For now, I will stop working on bentoml and other things to focus entirely on deepsource.

Also, I had a discussion with my team to participate in iHack Alpha Hackathon. We came up with an idea. Let's see how it goes. But the priority will be deepsource.

I look to contribute to BentoML someday, but right now all attention to deepsource. In the next few days, I'll be working on deepsource, hackathon project, kafka, and generative neural network.

Also, I ordered a coffee machine from Amazon. So I'm excited for it.

**Improvements**: Be more productive. Try to divide work and focus on fewer tasks.

**Learnings**: Python and some ML.

**Outcomes**: Idea for the hackathon project, introduction meet with the deepsource team, getting started with Anton.
