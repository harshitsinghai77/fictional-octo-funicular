Brave is an open source web browser built on top of Chromium, but has much more to offer.

# Why Brave?

## Security

Unlike Chrome, Brave doesn't sell your data to the highest bidder. Brave is better in privacy than Google Chrome. You can browse much more privately with Tor. Other browsers claim to have a “private mode,” but this only hides your history from others using your browser. Brave lets you use Tor right in a tab. Tor not only hides your history, it masks your location from the sites you visit by routing your browsing through several servers before it reaches your destination. These connections are encrypted to increase anonymity.

## Looks and feels exactly like Google Chrome.

If you love google chrome and can't imagine not using it, then brave is a perfect fit. It's gives exact feel like Chrome , you can migrate all your extensions and bookmarks too.

`Brave is faster and more private than Chrome while maintaining support for Chrome extensions.`

## Brave Rewards

Brave has it's own token called BAT(Basic Attention Token). You can earn tokens by viewing Brave Ads. Ads presented are based on your interests, as inferred from your browsing behavior. No personal data or browsing history ever leaves your browser. Brave

Even tho you won't be a millionaire earning BAT, probably you can earn 1-2 USD in a year, but it can be considered a good initiative. You can support content creators by giving them tip through BAT or any other token and contribute to websites directly through Brave Rewards.

## IPFS Support

Brave also has built-in IPFS Integration. If you don't know what IPFS than it's basically peer-to-peer distributed Web. Read more about IPFS [https://ipfs.io/](https://ipfs.io/)

IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the Web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS has been integrated into Brave’s desktop browser.

## Brave Search

Brave also has it's own search engine. I personally haven't used it much. But judging by the few search, it looks good. But I can't say if it's better than Google.

## Brave Talk for Privacy-Preserving Video Conferencing

Brave also has recently launches it's new privacy-focused video conferencing feature built directly into the Brave browser. It enables video calls without sacrificing privacy. Video calling is now an important tool for work, school, and social activities, and Brave Talk allows users to collaborate and connect online in a private-by-design environment.

`“Brave Talk users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, so an eavesdropper cannot listen in on users’ calls, and our servers don’t save metadata, so calls, images, and activities are never recorded or shared without user consent,”`
