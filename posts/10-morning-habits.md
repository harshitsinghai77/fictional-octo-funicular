Habits to make your morning better, be productive and hit the day feeling more alive and energetic.

## Freedom from distraction

Avoid distractions in the morning. This includes browsing your phone while eating breakfast or maybe watching YouTube videos while drinking cup of tea.

Morning filled with distraction often leads to unproductive day. Once distracted, it's hard to build the momentum and the productivity drops throughout the day.

## What to do?

Read a book or listen to a podcast. Do anything that makes you think, or get your brain juices flowing.

If you don't like to concentrate or focus early morning, then hitting the gym will help. Not only will it make your morning more energetic and lively but also clears your evening schedule.

## Routine Exploration

Set aside one hour to explore a subject alien to you. This could be accounting or finance or IPRS or maybe software laws. Whatever hightens your curosity.

Read a book, read a blog or anything releated to the new subject. Morning can be the best time to dive into the topic that fascinates you.

## Purist Priorities

Tremendously cut down your todo list. You can't achieve everything. It's impossible to pursue all your dreams at once.

Set aside only 2-3 things to do in the day. Just focus and commit all your time on those few goals.

Think like a genius and refine your priorities.

## Create your flow.

Morning is the best time to get into your FLOW state. The faster you can attain and longer you can maintain the FLOW state the better.

Waking up at 5am and getting into the FLOW is the best time. Not only you'll feel less distracted, your surroundings will also be quiet and there will be nobody to disturb you.

## Nourish your brain

Eat something healthy, this could be anything from banana protein powder shake or a herbal tea, anything works as long it's healthy, good for your brain and help you concentrate and get into your flow.

Hitting the gym in the morning and eating healthy food can have a profound positive impact on your brain and body.

## Elite Mastery

Don't be good at something, be elite. Geniuses don't want to be OK at something, they want to be perfect. If you want to attain elite mastery on a skill, then morning is the best time of your day.

## 1% per day

If you want to be great at something, don't spend the entire day learning about the new stuff, feeling exhausted and drained at the end and probably losing your interest in the subsequent days.

For example, when I started learning about neuroplasticity and neuroscience, I spent huge chunks of day researching and diving deep. I was so overwhelmed with the subject, that I got scared and lost interest.

Instead, the best way to go about this is to spend some time thinking and learning about the new subject, then gradually and subsquently grow into the subject. Learning a little bit more or a going a bit further is always an improvement. This is a slow process, but the benefits are long lasting.

Small chunks of learning over a month > Huge chunk of information in one day.

## Conclusion

This is my top habits for the "perfect morning". Hope you found something interesting. Have a great day ahead!!
