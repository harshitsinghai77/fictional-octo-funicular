Looking back I found that I've worked on multiple projects throughout and after college. It's difficult to keep track of all the side projects I've built or worked on so far. This post will help me to keep track of all my past, current and ongoing projects.

The better projects will be on top and as you go down you're see my least promising projects.

Note: Some app features won't work properly because the hosting limit has exceeded. The ML models were initially deployed for free using gcp/aws. But due to free limit exceeded and unable to pay for the cloud bills (need ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° for AWS bill), the backend serving the app has autoatically been termnined. Some features might still work as different ML endpoint were hosted in different cloud providers.

# Noiist

Note: The architecture is based on Airflow. The main idea was to learn and create a project using Airflow. Using Airflow was definitely a overkill and the architecture could have been made much better without it. But the purpose was to get hands-on with Airflow.

As I cannot host airflow in cloud (need ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° for AWS bill), the project needs manual run at midnight. I use to religiously run the airflow docker container locally on my system at midnight, but I've deserted the project recently (not worth the manual effort just to serve 5 customers).

# Pluto AI

Convert your favorite shot into any famous artistic painting using Pluto AI.

Pluto uses a TensorFlow implementation of Neural Style Transfer wrapped as a REST API. We also have a custom neural style transfer model [https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/pluto/blob/master/backend/model/nst.py](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/pluto/blob/master/backend/model/nst.py). Using Flask to serve the model. ReactJs to serve frontend. We use Firebase to store user images. Another parameter we record is the user rating of the image. This is for future optimization of our model.
