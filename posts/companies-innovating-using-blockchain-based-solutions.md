Before beginning my Blockchain journey, I was curiois to find about 2 things. First, which top companies are using blokchain and second, what are they using it for?

Here's a brief summary of what I found.

## Provenance

Dapps such as Provenance provide blockchain-based provenance tracking of materials to ensure no information is lost or manipulated within the supplier chain and goods of expected quality reach the end customer. One of the first applications built on Provenance has been focused on the food industry, to track the supply chain of ingredients from the point of collection, though the process of food manufacturing, to the final point of consumer sale. The aim of this system is to prove the food being sold has the claimed characteristics advertised to the consumers, such as location and sustainability of harvesting or breeding, whether the sources are organic or have been genetically modified, whether they’re coming from fair trade, and so on.

## Unilever

Unilever, the multinational consumer goods corporation, is developing a blockchain-based system in collaboration with a number of start-ups to track the tea supply chain starting from farmers in Malawi.

## Everledger

Everledger is a Dapp that aims to replace the paper certification process for diamonds with a blockchain-based system. A full digital record of a diamond, including its certificate ID and many properties, such as cut, grade, clarity, color, and carat, is stored on the blockchain, and the certificate ID is then engraved with a laser on the stone. All the information related to a diamond can then be retrieved at any point of the supply chain with the help of a scanner that reads the certificate ID from the stone. Almost 2 million diamonds have already been stored on Everledger.

## Pfizer

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer is partnering with the biotechnology company Genentech to develop MediLedger, a blockchain-based drug delivery tracking system. The aim is to verify the provenance and authenticity of Pfizer drug deliveries throughout the entire distribution chain to prevent thefts, fraud, and counterfeiting.

## Conclusion

That’s it for today, see you soon. :)
