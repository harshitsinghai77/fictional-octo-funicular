Looking back I found that I've worked on multiple projects throughout and after college. It's difficult to keep track of all the side projects I've built or worked on so far. This post will help me to keep track of all my past, current and ongoing projects.

The better projects will be on top and as you go down you're see my least promising projects.

Note: Some app features won't work properly because the hosting limit has exceeded. The ML models were initially deployed for free using gcp/aws. But due to free limit exceeded and unable to pay for the cloud bills (need ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° for AWS bill), the backend serving the app has autoatically been termnined. Some features might still work as different ML endpoint were hosted in different cloud providers.

Note: The architecture is based on Airflow. The main idea was to learn and create a project using Airflow. Using Airflow was definitely a overkill and the architecture could have been made much better without it. But the purpose was to get hands-on with Airflow.

As I cannot host airflow in cloud (need ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° for AWS bill), the project needs manual run at midnight. I use to religiously run the airflow docker container locally on my system at midnight, but I've deserted the project recently (not worth the manual effort just to serve 5 customers).

# Pluto AI

Convert your favorite shot into any famous artistic painting using Pluto AI.

Pluto uses a TensorFlow implementation of Neural Style Transfer wrapped as a REST API. We also have a custom neural style transfer model [https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/pluto/blob/master/backend/model/nst.py](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/pluto/blob/master/backend/model/nst.py). Using Flask to serve the model. ReactJs to serve frontend. We use Firebase to store user images. Another parameter we record is the user rating of the image. This is for future optimization of our model.

<img src="https://iili.io/Dd608v.png" />

Boilerplate code to create a REST API using Python, FastAPI, and Postgres..
Includes Pytest, CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions. Using `docker-compose` to automatically set Docker Posgtres Container and App on a seperate container. CI/CD pipeline will automatically push the most recent build to Docker Hub. Automatic test case -> dump the csv data to Posgtres docker container while running test cases in CI/CD Github Action container to mimic test data.

# MLOps Fetal Health Classifier

[https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/mlops-fetal-health-classifier](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/mlops-fetal-health-classifier)

<img src="https://iili.io/Ddt5Ob.png" />

Boilerplate code to containerized FastAPI Application to classify the health of a fetus as Normal, Suspect or Pathological using Cardiotocograms CTG data.

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

1. Normal
2. Suspect
3. Pathological

Using various classifers to train the dataset and comparing model performance to chose the best model out of all the classifiers.
The output is the Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 Score of the chosen classifier. Saved the model as `.joblib` and output the name of the saved model along with the accuracy.

Model deployed in Azure using Azure Machine Learning Studio
`Endpoint: http://5534d0ff-e421-4bee-bcb1-aa8d66be732d.centralindia.azurecontainer.io/score`

Note: Azure terminated the endpoint.

# Stackup

[https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/schedule-long-task-using-python-node-go](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/schedule-long-task-using-python-node-go)

<img src='https://iili.io/DdDiyg.png' />

Boilerplate code to implemented long running task using Node.js+Bull, Python+Celery, and Golang.

Long-running tasks usually require time and resources on the servers. For instance, when user trigger off a long running task, there is no way to tap into it and pause/stop/terminate the task, upon realizing that an erroneous request went through from one of the clients (mostly web or pipeline).

Solution:

1. User can now stop the long-running task at any given point in time, and can choose to resume or terminate it.
2. This will ensure that the resources like compute/memory/storage/time are used efficiently at our end, and do not go into processing tasks that have already been stopped.

Implemented the REST API in Node, Python and Go to pause/stop/terminate the long running task.

Features:

1. Schedule a new task
2. Check progress and status of the task
3. Pause/Resume the task
4. Terminate the task
5. Deploy the container
6. Increase the sleep time to mimick long-running task.

## Conclusion

We learned how to use GridSearchCV and Pipline to create machine learning Pipelines.

Thatâ€™s it for today, see you soon. :)
