# Work, Study, Relax with Nemo

## Nemo for work

Staying focused at work is more and more a challenge. Frequent interruptions, mainly in form of noise, are breaking our focus, increasing our stress level and lowering our productivity.

## Nemo at Home

Working from home requires a lot of self-discipline as you find yourself in an environment that you associate with your private time and which is full of distractions inviting you to procrastinate.

## Nemo while Studying

Nemo is a great tool to make studying more efficient. Nobody can concentrate for a prolonged amount of time, thus you can use Nemo to help you study in smaller sessions using our Timer.

## Nemo to Relax

Being in nature is one of the best ways to relax, relieve stress and refuel our batteries. If you donâ€™t have the chance to be in nature in moments when you need it, you can use Nemo to bring nature to you.

Background sounds of nature are especially stress relieving as we associate them with relaxation and calmness. But also being transported onto a cozy train ride while sipping a cup of coffee can be very relaxing.

## Nemo for Sleep

Being a good sleeper is the starting point to enjoy your day and to get the most out of it. The noise of the city or your wandering mind can leave you laying in bed for several hours without being able to fall asleep.
