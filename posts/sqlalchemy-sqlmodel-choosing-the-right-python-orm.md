title: "SQLAlchemy vs SQLModel: Choosing the Right Python ORM"
excerpt: "TWhen it comes to Python ORMs, SQLAlchemy has been the go-to choice for years, offering unparalleled flexibility and power. Now, SQLModel, a newer ORM built on top of SQLAlchemy with Pydantic, has joined the scene. Which one suits your needs best? Let’s break it down."

If you’ve spent any time working with Python and databases, chances are you’ve heard of SQLAlchemy. It’s been the gold standard for database interactions in Python since 2005, and its feature set and reliability have made it a favorite for developers. But now, there’s a new player in the game: SQLModel. Created by the developer of FastAPI, SQLModel combines the best of SQLAlchemy with modern Python features like type hints and Pydantic for data validation.

Let’s explore these two ORMs and see how they compare across complexity, learning curve, and community support.

### Why Use an ORM?
Instead of writing raw SQL queries to interact with your database, an ORM lets you use Python code to handle these operations. This approach simplifies database management and keeps your codebase more Pythonic.

SQLAlchemy and SQLModel are both ORMs, but they approach this task differently. While SQLAlchemy is a comprehensive tool designed to handle just about anything, SQLModel takes a more streamlined approach, catering to developers who prefer simplicity and modern Python conventions.

### Complexity: The Core Difference
SQLAlchemy is a powerhouse. It gives you fine-grained control over database interactions, supports complex relationships, and allows for advanced query optimization. This makes it ideal for large, intricate applications. However, with all that power comes complexity. Managing sessions, understanding its ORM mechanics, and setting up your project can feel overwhelming for beginners.

SQLModel, on the other hand, was designed with simplicity in mind. It builds on SQLAlchemy’s foundation but introduces features like Pydantic-based data validation and type hints. These modern Python practices make SQLModel more intuitive and easier to use, especially for small to medium projects. That said, SQLModel doesn’t yet offer the same depth of features for handling complex database scenarios.

### Learning Curve: Getting Started
SQLAlchemy comprehensive feature set means there’s a lot to learn, from session management to ORM relationships and query building. While SQLAlchemy becomes more manageable with experience, mastering it takes time and effort.

SQLModel makes the initial learning process much easier. Its syntax is cleaner and more Pythonic, and it benefits from Pydantic’s simplicity. If you’re familiar with FastAPI, using SQLModel feels natural. However, SQLModel’s relative newness means fewer advanced tutorials and examples are available, which might be a hurdle for developers tackling more complex problems.

### Community and Ecosystem
When choosing a tool, the size and activity of its community can make a huge difference. SQLAlchemy, as a veteran ORM, has a massive and active community. You’ll find countless tutorials, plugins, and extensions, and it’s been battle-tested in production for nearly two decades. This extensive ecosystem makes it a reliable choice for projects of any scale.

SQLModel, being newer, doesn’t yet have the same level of community support. However, it’s growing quickly, thanks in part to its connection with FastAPI. As more developers adopt it, the ecosystem is expanding, and resources are becoming more readily available.

### Which One Should You Choose?
The choice between SQLAlchemy and SQLModel ultimately comes down to your project’s needs.

If you’re building a large, complex application that requires advanced database interactions, SQLAlchemy is the clear choice. Its flexibility and proven reliability make it a trusted tool for production environments.

If you’re working on a smaller project, or if you value simplicity and modern Python features, SQLModel might be a better fit. It’s especially appealing for developers using FastAPI, as the two tools complement each other beautifully.

Both tools are excellent in their own right, and the best choice depends on your specific use case. Whichever you choose, you’ll be leveraging some of the best tools in the Python ecosystem.

That’s it for today, see you soon. :)
