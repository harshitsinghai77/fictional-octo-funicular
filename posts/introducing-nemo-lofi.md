## Whitenoise

White noise is a type of noise that contains all frequencies within the audible spectrum at equal intensity. It is called "white" noise because it is similar to the sound of white light, which contains all the colors of the spectrum at equal intensity. White noise is often used as a background noise to help people relax or sleep, or to mask other sounds. It is also used in some sound therapy techniques. Some common sources of white noise include the sound of a fan, the static from a radio or television, or the sound of waves crashing on a shore.
