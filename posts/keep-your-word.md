How many times have you been late to a meeting, or failed to deliver your assignment, project or report on time. Keeping your word is so simple, so profound, so obvious and yet we fail to do it.

## Your word

Keeping your word is as simple as it sounds. If you promise to deliver something to your manager, your boss or even to yourself, make sure you deliver it when promised.

This make your reliable and trustworthy. This gives your manager mental space, and you can be someone who your manager can trust implicitly.

Be someone who says they're going to do something and actualy does it.

## Execution

You quickly realize in business, you can plan all you want, but without execution you can never push anything forward.

Predictable execution is when you want something to get done, it gets done. Being someone who is reliable and sticks to his word, your co-founder can count on you to drive things forwards and make things happen.

Treat your work like gold. This is such a great resource for any cofounder or manager.

Doing what you promised and delivering it on time also gives mental space to your manager to allocate their attention to someting else.

## Be better than 95%

Most people are very very bad keeping their word.

Think about how many times a person is late to the meeting, or promise something and then says he needs few days more.

Don't be that person. Simply by having awarness of what you promise, and the word you give to others, and actually following through on it, you can be the most reliable and trustworth professional literally by 95% of people.

## Exponential driver of success.

Keeping your word goes unspoken because it is so obvious. If mastered, it is an exponential driver of growth.

## Personal life.

This also goes to your own personal life. Many of us our horrible when keeping our word to ourselves. Keeping your word is very important to your personal as well as your professional life.

When you say you're going to finish that module, complete that chapter, read a book, hit the gym, stick to your word and deliver.

## Conclusion

Don't treat your word like trash.

Thatâ€™s it for today, see you soon. :)
