## Be productive with Nemo

Nemo is your little helper and companion no matter if you need to focus, tune out other noises or if you want to have a moment of calm and relax.

## Nemo is your digital place for focus.

With Nemo you can mix and match different sounds in order to create your perfect sound environment. We currently offer 28 high quality background sounds that you can play individually or combine with each other. You can adjust the volume for each sound in order to customize your combinations to your needs and make them your own.

## Mix different sounds and create your perfect sound environment to work and relax.

We provide background sounds that help to mask annoying noises in order to keep you sane, improve your focus and boost your productivity.

## Keep track of your day.

Our anlytics helps you with insights on how your week went and how much hours were your productive each day.

## No matter where you are working from, once out of focus, it takes you an average of 25 minutes to fully focus again!

Distractions are everywhere and most of the time you have very little control over them: a sound notification from your phone or computer, someone on a call next to you, people coming in and out, or a simple thought youâ€™re having in your mind giving you no rest.

## Focus your energy to study better.

With our Timer, students can stay concentrated in small blocks of time in order to be more efficient without draining too much energy. Moreover, frequent breaks allow students to recharge and enter the next session fresh and energized. The length of the Timer and the Breaks can be customized individually by each user.
