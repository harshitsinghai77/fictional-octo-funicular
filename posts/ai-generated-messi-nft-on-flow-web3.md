As fans around the world celebrate Messi's victory in the World Cup, I am excited to announce the launch of a limited edition AI-generated Messi NFT on Flow using Cadence. These unique NFTs are created using Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth, and will only be available for a limited time.

## Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth

Stable Diffusion is a method of generating AI images that involves the use of a generative model to create a smooth, continuous sequence of images. This technique uses a process called diffusion, which involves the movement of particles through a medium, to create a series of images that evolve over time. The resulting images tend to be smooth and continuous, with a high level of detail and realism.

Dreambooth, on the other hand, is a technique for generating AI images that involves training a deep neural network to generate images based on a given set of input images. This technique uses a process called "dreaming" to generate new images that are similar to the input images, but with slight variations and distortions. The resulting images tend to be more abstract and surreal, with a less realistic appearance.

Both Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth can be used to generate a wide range of AI images, including portraits, landscapes, and abstract art. These techniques are often used in conjunction with other AI techniques, such as image generation and style transfer, to create even more complex and sophisticated images.

## Get stated with installing wallet extension

If you're interested in experiencing the future of art and collecting, I invite you to join me in minting your own AI-generated Messi NFT on Flow. It's easy to get started ‚Äì simply connect your wallet using Blocto and you'll be ready to go in just 10 seconds.

## Flow

But what is Flow and why did I choose to create my NFTs on this new blockchain network? Flow was designed from the ground up to be accessible and scalable for mainstream use. This means that anyone, including your grandma, can start using Flow apps in just 10 seconds with their email address ‚Äì no wallet setup required. And with low transaction fees and fast speeds, Flow is perfect for building and using web3 apps like NFT marketplaces.

When I learned about Flow, a new blockchain network built for mainstream use, I knew it was the perfect platform for creating my own limited edition AI-generated Messi NFTs. And with the help of Cadence, the programming language used on Flow, I was able to write smart contract and mint my own NFTs.

## Cadence

Cadence is the programming language used on Flow, and it was created with a focus on clarity and ease of use. The syntax is inspired by other popular languages like Swift and Rust, and it was specifically designed to be well-suited to the unique requirements of blockchain programming.

## AI and Web3

As someone who is passionate about both art and technology, I am always looking for new ways to combine these two worlds. That's why I was excited to explore the world of NFTs and the potential they have for creating unique, digital art experiences.

I encourage you to mint your own AI-generated Messi NFT on Flow and join me in this exciting new world of web3. And once you're done, be sure to share your minted NFT in this [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/harshit_778/status/1607256821630390272) . I can't wait to see what you create!

## Conclusion

That‚Äôs it for today, see you soon. :)
