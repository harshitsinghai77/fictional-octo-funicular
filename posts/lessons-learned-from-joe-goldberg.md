I've been bing watching Netflix's Pyscho triller, YOU. Having read the all the three novels and watched all the 3 seasons, here's what you can learn from Joe Goldeberg minus the killing part.

## Be Calm Always, even when, especially when you're put in extreme, intense or pressing situation?

Joe is the epitome of "how to keep your nerves calm" when put in pressing sitation. He never get nervous, and always thinks clearly.

Ofcouse he takes his decisions irrationally when killing or throwing someone in his cage. But when the shit hits the fan, he never loses his composure, thinking things through and always saying the right things and keeping his head cool. He never loses the focus or say anything he shouldn't.

He had been kidnapped, held at knifepoint, held at gunpoint, lost his finger to casper, been locked in a cage and somehow in all of those sitations he kept his nerve above baseline.

## Eye for detail

He keeps his mess clean, no stones unturned in whatever that he does.

Yeah, I get it, he left the mug-of-piss at Peach Salinger's house. But you have to be considerate of the fact that he severely hit his head from the car accident on top of the beating from his neighbor.

Other than that, he always executes his plan to perfection.

## You don't have to answer everything

We think we have to keep the conversation going, avoid any pauses or moment of silence when we're talking to someone.

Joe always pick up the questions that he wants to answer. He has no obligations to answer everything he's been asked. Sometimes silence is the right answer.

## Old-school

Being old-school is what seperates Joe from the rest of the glory-hunters. Joe is always old-school, his dressing style is rather simple, tacky and attractive. He doesn't indulge to social media for the most part, maybe ocassionally using it for stalking.

His lifestyle is old school yet charming and attractive.

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it for today, see you soon. :)
