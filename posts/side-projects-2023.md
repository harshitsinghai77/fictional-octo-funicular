Supporting creators 3.0. A platform that helps you support your favourite creators without draining your pockets.

A platform where people can support their favourite creators. To support creators they stake some amount in the creator's pool, this complete amount can be withdrawn and creators get the interest generated!

We're all familiar with how we support creators in the Web2 world. We have been picking our brains to figure out how we would make this a better experience on Web3. Loop is a content-creator-first platform built to address the needs of Creator 3.0.

Imagine if you could support your favorite creators without actually spending anything!

Behind the scenes, we're using the Aave protocol to stake user funds and generate interest. The users can get their funds back anytime and the creators can withdraw the interest generated on the pool.

With Loop, creators can also LIVE stream their content and do much more.

# UbeGrants

[https://ube-grants.vercel.app/](https://ube-grants.vercel.app/)

<img src='https://iili.io/HcQoI0G.png' />

UbeGrants is a Hackathon project that allows for milestone-based payments using smart contracts.

Ubeswap is in the process of transitioning platform decision making to the Ubeswap DAO (composed of all UBE holders). In order to facilitate contracts and grants fulfillment by the DAO, we have developed a set of smart contracts with the following functions:

1. Milestone-based payments: The DAO can transfer a grant lump sum to the contract, which will then disburse the grant according to pre-determined milestone completion dates and amounts.
2. Milestone payment approval and cancellation: A DAO Agent multisig wallet has the ability to approve or cancel milestone payments. If a grant's milestones are not met, the funds will be returned to the DAO. These contracts are written in Solidity and are built using the Hardhat Ethereum development environment.

### Gitcoin

Here's the problem statement: [https://gitcoin.co/issue/29600](https://gitcoin.co/issue/29600)

### Live URLs

1. Subgraph: [https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/shreyaspapi/ubegrants](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/shreyaspapi/ubegrants)
2. Frontend: [http://ube-grants.vercel.app/](http://ube-grants.vercel.app/)

### Installation

To use these contracts, you will need to have the following installed:

1. Solidity
2. Hardhat

Once these dependencies are installed, you can clone this repository and install the remaining dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.

### Backend

The contracts are written in solidity and are deployed on the Goerli and CELO alfregos testnets. You can view the contract on the Goerli etherscan here: [goerli.etherscan.io/address/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x41bb6856e824af55fa2f10d68cf5a74c351cba41)

Contracts: [contracts/UbeMilestones.sol](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/ube-grants/blob/main/contracts/contracts/UbeMilestones.sol)

### Frontend

Frontend is written in react and allows users to interact with the contracts on the blockchain.

Note: The architecture is based on Airflow. The main idea was to learn and create a project using Airflow. Using Airflow was definitely a overkill and the architecture could have been made much better without it. But the purpose was to get hands-on with Airflow.

As I cannot host airflow in cloud (need 💰💰💰 for AWS bill), the project needs manual run at midnight. I use to religiously run the airflow docker container locally on my system at midnight, but I've deserted the project recently (not worth the manual effort just to serve 5 customers).

Turn Design Mockups into HTML Code using Deep Learning

### Why Peach Pixel?

1. Difficulty faced by small businesses, local traders and inviduals with no technical background to create a website to showcase their product or service that looks similar or exactly like their requirement - More than 50% of small/medium-sized businesses in India do not have their own website

We use deep learning algorithms for front-end automation. We’ll teach a neural network how to code a basic HTML and CSS website based on a picture of a design mockup.

With Peach Pixel every user (regardless of the amount of technical knowledge they possess) right from a ten year old to sixty five year old can create and deploy a website - which looks exactly like they envisioned it to be - in matter of minutes. The same would be achieved using the following following 5 steps:

# EthereumETL

<img src="https://iili.io/HcQ3akX.png" />

Cetl is a short ETL pipeline that does the following:

1. Download a fixed set of ethereum blocks (lets say around 20K latest blocks, which should cover ~3 days) as CSV files
2. Convert into a better format that optimises for storage and retrieval
3. Load into Kafka for real-time analytics
4. Load into a columnar store (like Clickhouse) for ad-hoc analysis

### Real-time analytics

1. The moving average of the number of transactions in a block (for a window of 5 blocks)
2. Total value of gas every hour
3. Running count of number of transfers sent and received by addresses

### Ad-hoc analysis

1. How many ERC-20 token contracts were found? (token_address gives the address of the ERC-20 contract)
2. Current balance for any token address (difference between value in transfers involving the address in to_address and from_address)
3. Highest transaction in a block

# deployFlag

[github.com/harshitsinghai77/deployFlag](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/deployFlag)

<img src="https://iili.io/HBPBlTu.png" />

deployFlag is boilercode for training machine learning algorithms asynchronous using process or threads using Celery's distributed task queue.

Ocave and deployFlag are distributed services which communicate on a producer consumer system pattern. They both run on seperate machines and interact with each other via a broker service (RabbitMQ).

This can be used for usecases where you want to train a unique machine learning model for each unique user. The model should be lightweighted and minimal. This approach won't be able to train large ML models, might run into memory error.

# Certility - Fetal Health Classifier using MLOps

<img src="https://iili.io/Ddt5Ob.png" />

Boilerplate code to containerized FastAPI Application to classify the health of a fetus as Normal, Suspect or Pathological using Cardiotocograms CTG data.

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

1. Normal
2. Suspect
3. Pathological

Using various classifers to train the dataset and comparing model performance to chose the best model out of all the classifiers.
The output is the Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 Score of the chosen classifier. Saved the model as `.joblib` and output the name of the saved model along with the accuracy.

Model deployed in Azure using Azure Machine Learning Studio.

# Stackup

[github.com/harshitsinghai77/schedule-long-task-using-python-node-go](https://github.com/harshitsinghai77/schedule-long-task-using-python-node-go)

<img src='https://iili.io/DdDiyg.png' />

Boilerplate code to implemented long running task using Node.js+Bull, Python+Celery, and Go.

Long-running tasks usually require time and resources on the servers. For instance, when user trigger off a long running task, there is no way to tap into it and pause/stop/terminate the task, upon realizing that an erroneous request went through from one of the clients (mostly web or pipeline).

Solution:

1. User can now stop the long-running task at any given point in time, and can choose to resume or terminate it.
2. This will ensure that the resources like compute/memory/storage/time are used efficiently at our end, and do not go into processing tasks that have already been stopped.

Implemented the REST API in Node, Python and Go to pause/stop/terminate the long running task.

Features:

1. Schedule a new task
2. Check progress and status of the task
3. Pause/Resume the task
4. Terminate the task
5. Deploy the container
6. Increase the sleep time to mimick long-running task.

## Conclusion

That's it, all the side projects that I'm little proud of. Lot of them sounds basic but at the time they were a good learning experience. A lot of the projects are broken because of excessive AWS/GCP bills. I tried to maintain them until a certain point, but eventually gave up. No one really uses the project so It's fruitless to spend time supporting and maintaining them.

I'll be building more projects (hopefully meaningful) in the future. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration.

That’s it for today, see you soon. :)
