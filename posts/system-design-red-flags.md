Things to wary when developing system architecture.

1. Over-engineering is a real disease.
2. Many engineers delight in design purity and ignore tradeoffs.
3. They are often unaware of the compounding costs of over-engineered systems, and many companies pay a high price for that ignorance. Do not demonstrate this tendency when it comes to system design.
4. Other red flags include narrow mindedness, stubbornness, etc.

Thatâ€™s it for today, see you soon. :)
